## Front-end Capstone
### Project Name
Audition Room
### Overview
This app will allow directors, stage managers, or anyone involved with the audtion process of a production to digitally track actors through the full cycle of the audtions. Actors can be assigned to productions and marked as cast or not. This app will help directors organize and track all of their overlapping productions and referance all actors who have auditioned for their productions.
### Personal Motivation
Over the course of my seven years as a stage manager, I was involved with many auditions. Each audition we went through a lot of paper for each actor to track their information and remember thei audition. I want to create a more environmentally friendly way to track that information. I have also work worked with directors who like to work with the actors from past productions and it would be helpful to have all of the information of actors from past productions stored online to reference when starting a new production.
